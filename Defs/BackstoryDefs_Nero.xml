    <baseDesc>[PAWN_nameDef] grew up as an orphan in Fortuna, unaware of [PAWN_possessive] true heritage as the son of Vergil. [PAWN_possessive] right arm manifested demonic power early, leading to fear and isolation from other children. Despite this, [PAWN_pronoun] developed a strong sense of justice and protection for the innocent, though [PAWN_possessive] emotional nature often led to conflicts with authority figures.</baseDesc>

    <baseDesc>[PAWN_nameDef] discovered [PAWN_possessive] true heritage as a descendant of Sparda and learned to harness the power of the Devil Bringer.
