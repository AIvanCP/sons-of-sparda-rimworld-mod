    <titleShort>devil child</titleShort>
    <baseDesc>[PAWN_nameDef] grew up as an orphan in Fortuna, unaware of [PAWN_possessive] true heritage as the son of Vergil. [PAWN_possessive] right arm manifested demonic power early, leading to fear and isolation from other children. Despite this, [PAWN_pronoun] developed a strong sense of justice and protection for the innocent, though [PAWN_possessive] emotional nature often led to conflicts with authority figures.</baseDesc>

    <title>devil bringer</title>
    <titleShort>devil hunter</titleShort>
    <baseDesc>[PAWN_nameDef] discovered [PAWN_possessive] true heritage as a descendant of Sparda and learned to harness the power of the Devil Bringer. [PAWN_pronoun] joined the Order of the Sword in Fortuna before becoming an independent devil hunter. [PAWN_possessive] demonic arm grants [PAWN_objective] incredible strength, but [PAWN_possessive] emotional nature and protective instincts sometimes cloud [PAWN_possessive] judgment. Unlike [PAWN_possessive] father and uncle, [PAWN_pronoun] maintains stronger connections to humanity.</baseDesc>
