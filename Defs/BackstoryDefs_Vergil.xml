    <baseDesc>Born as the son of the legendary Dark Knight Sparda, [PAWN_nameDef] witnessed [PAWN_possessive] mother's death and blamed [PAWN_possessive] own weakness.

    <title>seeker of ultimate power</title>
    <titleShort>dark slayer</titleShort>
    <baseDesc>[PAWN_nameDef] pursued ultimate power at any cost, even splitting [PAWN_possessive] human and demon halves to achieve it. [PAWN_pronoun] mastered the legendary Yamato sword and developed spatial cutting techniques that can slice through dimensions. Though [PAWN_possessive] quest for power led to defeat and humiliation, [PAWN_pronoun] has learned to temper [PAWN_possessive] obsession with a newfound understanding of what truly matters. [PAWN_possessive] precision in combat is unmatched, but [PAWN_pronoun] remains cold and antisocial.</baseDesc>
